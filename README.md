# BuiltDifferentArucoProcessor
This code was written to work with a RaspberryPi Camera module

An integral part of the Built Different team's software, this program was designed to identify and process an Aruco Quick Response (QR) code on a reconnaissance drone. Using the Aruco code, 3D State-Space variables are communicated to a flight controller on a carrier drone so that it can safely position itself for in-air landing or deployment of the smaller recon drone.
